## Hashtables

HashTable : hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. 

add() : method takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

get(): method takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

containes(): method takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

hash() : method results in the least number of collisions, meaning, No two sets of information should have the same hash values.

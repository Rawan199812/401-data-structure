## Graph
Implement Graph. The graph represented as an adjacency list
include the methods:

1. add node : method take the value and adds a node to the graph returns the added node

2. add edge : method adds a new edge between two nodes (Both nodes should already be in the Graph) in the graph and connect 2 nodes by the edge, weight (optional).

3. get nodes : method returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

4. get neighbors : method take the node and returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

5. size : method returns the total number of nodes in the graph
